* The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with.

* Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data

* MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use

* MongoDB is free and open-source, published under the GNU Affero General Public License
